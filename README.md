# MultiAltizAlignment_MXSP7

Date: 09/22/2024

**MIL Version** MIL X SP7

**Type** New example

**Description**  
This example shows how to automatically align point clouds acquired by multiple Altiz using a simple bar with holes.
The distance between holes must be known precisely. This example does not correct the rotations around the X-axis and the Z-axis.
It is therefore important to position the camera in such a way that there are no rotations around these axes. The distances between holes are measured along the Altiz X axis.

The project structure, including the xml and png files, aims to be copied in "\Users\Public\Documents\Matrox Imaging\MIL\Examples\BoardSpecific\MultiAltizAlignment" of the MIL installation directory to be displayed by the MIL example launcher.
